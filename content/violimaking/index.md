Title: Build a violin
*/

This is my book about how to build a violin from scratch
==========================
 
One of my favorite hobby is violinmaking and I decided to translate into English the book I've wrote and bublish
it on my site.

I'll do publush about 50% of each chapter for free and I can send the rest of each chapter for $1 by email.
If after reading of my book you'll have questions I can also publish the reply as addition to the chapter.
